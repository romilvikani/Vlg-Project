# Vlg-Project
Project’s Aim\
•	To collect 5-15 images of a rubber duck and then manually annotate them i.e. put bounding boxes around them to get the labels for (x,y,w,h).\
•	Load a pretrained SSD with ResNet-50 and finetune it on these images.\
•	Run the object detection algorithm on a new image to identify the rubber duck.
